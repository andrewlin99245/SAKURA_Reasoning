However, within this order, there are several different families that include various types of amphibians with different characteristics and habitats. The specific family of the animal in the audio file depends on its physical traits and habitat, but since it is an amphibian that lives near water, it is most likely a member of the family Ambystomatidae, such as the western toad or the California giant toad.",

Cows are known for their digestive process that involves chewing cud, a plant material they consume to break it down into simpler compounds that can be absorbed by their rumen. Moocowing typically involves the cow producing several loud moos as part of its normal behavior and communication with other members of its herd. While cows do move around and may occasionally jump, flapping wings and climbing trees are not typical activities associated with this species.",
